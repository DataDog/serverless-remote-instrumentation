# Serverless Remote Instrumentation

The [remote instrumentation for AWS Lambda](https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/aws_lambda/remote_instrumentation/) feature allows you to easily bulk-instrument your lambda functions with Datadog.

This repository contains the remote instrumentation template and remote instrumenter lambda code for Datadog's Lambda Remote Instrumentation feature. The template can be found [here](https://github.com/DataDog/serverless-remote-instrumentation/blob/prod/template.yaml), and the remote instrumenter lambda code can be found [here](https://github.com/DataDog/serverless-remote-instrumentation/tree/prod/src).

New versions of remote instrumentation are published under [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DataDog/serverless-remote-instrumentation/releases).
